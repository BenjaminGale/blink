Module: Blink.View.Selection

Pure helpers built on top of "Blink.View"'s 'Selection' type: reading the
low\/high bound of a range, collapsing it to a cursor, and moving its
active end. None of these touch 'Blink.View.ViewContext' -- read the
current selection with 'Blink.View.getSelection' and pass the result
through these.
